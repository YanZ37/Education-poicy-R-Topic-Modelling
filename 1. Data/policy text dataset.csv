1054,engineering,"1. Assessment of professional theory courses
The professional ability assessment of this major draws on the successful experience of existing majors, and sets up flexible and diverse assessment methods according to the nature of the courses.
Effective reforms have been carried out on examination methods, and an assessment system for theoretical and practical teaching has basically been formed to promote teaching reform and improve teaching quality. The assessment methods of theoretical teaching are diversified, such as open-book, closed-book, written test, oral test, papers, etc. The determination of grades is based on three parts: exam grades (50%) + skill grades (30%) and usual grades (20%).
In view of the particularity of this major, the use of written examinations cannot accurately reflect the mastery of students' professional skills. For this reason, we have reformed the assessment methods of some courses. We adopt flexible examination methods, including written examination, actual laboratory assessment, teacher's questioning and other examination methods. For professional training, we have formulated detailed assessment standards and methods, and assess based on daily performance, innovation ability, comprehensive design ability, etc., scientifically and truly assess the mastery of students' professional skills.
The course design assessment is composed of five parts:
(1) Regular attendance 10%
(2) Practical hands-on ability 30% 
(3) Innovation ability  20%
(4) Q&A, defense 20% 
(5) Design report 20%

1056,engineering,"5. suggestions on teaching assessment
Forming a comprehensive and reasonable assessment system is one of the important contents of the teaching reform of higher vocational education, and it is an important entry point and breakthrough point of the teaching reform. It includes two parts of assessment. The assessment is the assessment of the teacher's teaching process and the assessment of the students' academic performance. The basic principles of ""four combinations"" are adopted for the assessment of students. One is the combination of professional ability and professionalism assessment; the other is the combination of theoretical assessment and practical assessment. The third is the combination of formative assessment and summative assessment; the fourth is the combination of student self-assessment, peer assessment and teacher assessment as a comprehensive assessment of the completion of unit tasks. The assessment of students focuses on the following three aspects.
(1) Diversified examination formats
In order to better examine the comprehensive quality and ability of students, it is necessary to adopt a variety of assessment forms. Based on traditional written examinations (closed-book examinations, open-book examinations), achievement assessment (major assignments, course design and thesis, etc.), operational task assessment (practical operations, etc.), oral examinations, computer-based and online assessment, self-assessment and group assessment (student course unit learning report, group cooperation and cooperation awareness, team contribution, etc.) and other assessment methods are carried out. In particular, the combination of two or more assessment forms is advocated to comprehensively assess students.
(2) Socialization of assessment content
The content of the assessment should refer to the requirements of the professional position, introduce professional qualification standards, introduce industry technical standards, reduce the content of rote memorization, increase the content of hands-on operation assessment, and pay attention to the assessment of students' learning ability, professional ability and comprehensive quality. Introduce social occupational skills assessment standards into the assessment of corresponding courses, such as ""Motor and Electrical Control Technology"", ""Programmable Controller Technology and Application"", ""CNC Machine Tool Electrical Control"" and other courses, according to the national maintenance electrician intermediate and advanced and technician appraisal standards.
(3) Full assessment process
Break the ""one size fits all"" final assessment time, and achieve the whole-process assessment.
"

3) The assessment method, refromed from the traditional final “examination paper”, to a combination of the final exam with the usual grades. The final exam mainly examines students' mastery of relevant knowledge points throughout the course, the usual grades include research-based learning, case analysis ability, discussion ability, on-site hands-on ability), it is the embodiment of students' ability to analyse, solve and practice problems in the whole learning process, and truly achieve the improvement of students' ability.
4) Theoretical teaching adopts the method of combining written examination and practical training assessment; comprehensive training adopts the method of combining thesis (or report) and defence; comprehensive practical training and internship adopts the method of combining internship report, oral examination, and comprehensive operation ability assessment. For the theoretical teaching of this course, the scores are as follows: 60% for the written test and 40% for the practical training assessment; for the comprehensive training: 40% for the thesis (or report) and 60% for the defence; The results are assessed as follows: 20% for the practical training (internship) report, 20% for the oral exam, and 60% for the comprehensive operational ability assessment.
5) In project-based teaching, typical work tasks are used as the basis for assessment, flexible and diverse assessment methods are adopted, and specific performance assessment methods are formulated. When setting the assessment method, theory and practice are combined. There are practical training task assessment that mainly assess professional abilities, and knowledge assessment that test cognitive levels. The teaching effect assessment adopts the method of combining formative assessment and summative assessment, and focuses on assessing students' professional ability through the combination of theory and practice.
2. On-the-job internship assessment: The learning of modern apprenticeship is an organic combination of practical training in the enterprise and learning in the classroom. Generally, the form of school-enterprise cooperation and work-study integration is implemented. Based on the three-year school system, students spend 1/2 of their time in enterprises for training and 1/2 of their time in schools to learn theoretical knowledge and professional skills. In the form of ""1.5+0.5+1"", one and a half years are spent in school to learn theoretical knowledge and master the most basic skills, and half a year to conduct ""project training"" or ""rotation training"" in the enterprise (depending on the actual situation of the enterprise), and then go to relevant enterprises for “on-the-job internship” or “follow-up internship” in the following year. 
The results of off-campus internships are composed of three parts: the assessment of professional teachers in the school, the assessment of part-time teachers outside the school, and the appraisal of the internship unit. The professional instructors in the school should assess the students' internship situation according to the students' on-the-job internship assignment statement, combined with the students' on-the-job internship summary, stage report and phased inspection, and the score accounts for 50% of the total score. Off-campus part-time instructors should assess their on-the-job internship status based on students' professional skills, work attitude, and work discipline during the internship process, and the score will account for 30% of the total score. The internship unit mainly assesses the student's attendance, work attitude, work results and performance, and the score accounts for 20% of the total score."

According to the characteristics and requirements of different courses, various methods such as written test, oral test, practical operation, work display, and result report can be used for assessment.
Formative assessment: Take job quality, moral quality, innovation quality, physical quality and other quality factors and the quality of project completion as the formative assessment indicators of the course, and use the formative assessment results as the main basis for assessing students, reaching 40% or above of the overall assessment score. The formative assessment is mainly based on teacher assessment, and the formative assessment results are composed of two parts: the school-specified factor (70%) and the course group and the teacher's self-determined factor (30%). The prescribed factors are mainly students' study attendance, learning process performance, homework completion rate and accuracy rate, project completion rate and other factors of test results. The self-determined factor is formulated by the course group and the teacher according to the teaching situation of the course. Before the class, you need to go to the professional teaching centre for filing.
Summative assessment: At the end of the course, the college will organize a course examination.
Internship Assessment
At the end of the internship, the enterprise teachers and the school teachers jointly complete the comprehensive assessment of the students' internship performance, as follows: the enterprise teachers will assess the basic technical ability, job adaptability, work attitude, professional quality, and work performance in the ""Student on-the-job internship Manual”, fill in the assessment comments and grades in the corresponding columns, and sign and confirm, stamp the official seal of the unit, and the assessment is based on excellent, good, medium, pass, and fail. The schoolteachers conduct the assessment according to the enterprise internship appraisal form, the internship report written by the students and the students' internship performance, and implement a 5-level  score based on a percentage system based on excellent, good, medium, pass, and fail, accounting for 30% of the total assessment score.

1074,engineering,"The assessment of students’ academic quality should reflect the ability itself, show the guiding ideology of the school, and use the subject theory as the main assessment mode to realize the scientificity, realization and flexibility of the course assessment, and adopt flexible and diverse assessment methods, such as closed-book, open-book, oral examination, practical operation, project design, design and production, publication of papers, keynote summary, research report, multimedia report, overall inspection, etc., strengthen the formative assessment, and examine the ability and quality of students.
Part of the assessment methods in the public learning subjects still use the current assessment mode, that is, English (college English, professional English), computer basics, advanced mathematics, and physical education use the examination method, and moral education use the inspection method.
English and computer can use grade examination or certificate assessment instead of course assessment.
Professional and professional development courses and the whole week of practical training to establish a course assessment system focusing on ability assessment and focusing on formative assessment. Practical classes should be assessed for operational skills, and some representative work tasks are selected from actual jobs as assessment content. The test situation is required to be as like the actual work situation as possible.
According to the difference of course content and course nature, the formative assessment results are added to the usual grades. The assessment of students' academic quality is divided into three types according to the proportion of practical sections:
First, it is based on knowledge and theory transfer. For courses with few practical sections, it is recommended to take 20% of the usual grades and 80% of the paper grades. The usual grades here include not only student attendance, class participation, homework completion, and completion of experimental practice tasks, but also students' formative assessment results during the entire learning process.
Second, theoretical knowledge and skills are equally important. Courses with practical sections similar to classroom teaching can take the form of 50% of the usual grades and 50% of the test paper grades.
The third is based on skills and abilities. Courses based on practical teaching can adopt the form of complete formative assessment.
The assessment of job-fixed training should be combined with the enterprise practice assessment. The enterprise practice assessment is organized by the enterprise personnel to assess the students according to the enterprise's job assessment standards."
1075,engineering,"The course teaching achieves the combination of ""teaching, learning, doing and assessing"". The assessment of students' performance are mainly composed of formative assessment and summative assessment, and at the same time, value-added assessment and comprehensive assessment are integrated. Strengthen the education of students' learning management and learning habits in the whole learning process before, during and after class, pay special attention to the assessment of the learning process, and the assessment results must be recordable and traceable.
1. Public quality courses are divided into two categories: online teaching and offline teaching. Online teaching consists of two aspects: course study completion and online exams, of which study completion accounts for 20% and online exams account for 80%. Offline teaching includes formative assessment and summative assessment. The formative assessment consists of attendance, homework (experimental report), class participation, formative assessment (including skills), etc., accounting for 60% of the total score (required attendance accounts for 20% of the total score). Summative assessment consists of theoretical examinations and skill assessment, accounting for 40% of the total score. For courses without skill assessment, the theoretical examination scores are calculated.
2. Professional skills courses: The assessment of professional skills courses adopts a learning assessment mode that combines online learning with classroom participation, practical training assessment and theoretical examination, and formative assessment and summative assessment. Online learning accounts for 30%, mainly including: online check-in, online course learning, and online discussion and interaction; classroom participation accounts for 20%, mainly including: classroom attendance, in-class Q&A, and homework; practical training assessment accounts for 30%, mainly including: skill assessment; theoretical examination accounts for 20%; formative assessment consists of attendance, homework (experimental report), classroom participation (including online test), formative assessment (including skills), etc. In principle, it does not exceed 50% of the total score (Among them, attendance does not exceed 10% of the total score); the summative assessment consists of theory examination, skill assessment, project demonstration and defense, and in principle, it does not exceed 60% of the total score.
3. Professional skills training: According to the job requirements, the content of the certification examination is integrated, with students as the main body, the combination of online and offline, the integration of professional quality and professional assessment, and the combination of formative assessment and works assessment. Skills training results are composed of usual scores, skills operations, training works (results) and comprehensive training reports. The total score of the comprehensive project training shall be calculated according to the usual grades of no more than 20%, skill operation no less than 30%, practical training works (results) no less than 30%, and comprehensive training report no more than 20%. The formative assessment consists of attendance, homework (experimental report), class participation, formative assessment (including skills), etc., with no less than 60% of the total score. The works assessment consists of skill assessment, project demonstration and defense, no higher than 40% of the total score.
4. On-the-job internship: The formative assessment consists of attendance, internship report, corporate internship summary, instructor assessment, corporate assessment, etc., accounting for 80% of the total score (attendance is required to account for 35% of the total score). The summative assessment consists of graduation design works and graduation defense, accounting for 20% of the total score.
5. Professional quality development courses: Optional courses (including lectures) will be assessed with reference to public quality courses, and the attendance ratio should not be lower than 40% of the total score. The grades for limited optional courses are made up of formative assessment including attendance, homework (experimental reports), classroom participation, and formative assessment (including skills), which should not be higher than 50% of the total grade (attendance is required to be at least 20% of the total grade). If it is an online course, you need to complete online learning and online assessment.
6. The assessment criteria for graduation design achievements is in accordance with the requirements of Hunan Province's ""Notice on Printing and Issuing"" (Xiang Jiao Fa [2019] No. 22), and the provincial department's ""Selective Eaxmination Indicators for Students in Higher Vocational Colleges"" as the basis for formulating the assessment standards for graduation design of each major, the scoring indicators are refined. The grades of graduation design are composed of teachers’ review grades, graduation design results and defense results. The total score must be above 60 points to be qualified; those who fail to pass the graduation design are not allowed to complete the calculation formula: graduation design grade = process grade × 10%+comprehensive score of achievement review ×80%+defense score ×10%.
7. Social practice activities: During the study period, participating in social welfare activities, labor practice activities, participating in competitions sponsored by various government departments at all levels, winning awards, obtaining vocational qualification certificates, skill level certificates, etc. can be recognized as certain credits, which can be determined according to the credits. Some credits can be replaced according to the credit system management method."
